The contents of {user_input} are questions and answers. 
- ANSWER is likely to be an engineer's answer, so we organize the dataset as well as we can around the content of ANSWER.
- If it's long, try to make it as meaningful and generalized as possible.
- If you have multiple queries, create a dataset that is implicit and generic enough to allow Q&A to occur
- Tables are output as a table structure via | in markdown format.
- Please output it as a QnA dataset as shown in the example.
- If there is a link in the content, please print the information of the link along with the information of the content in the format of link address.

I’m using a switch to connect the PC and the embedded device to the same IP network.\nThe connection works fine. But if I disconnect this PC and connect other PC with the same IP address (MAC is different), the connect doen’t work well anymore.\nThe problem is that W5500 sends the UDP packets to the old MAC address although this MAC is not available anymore (the old PC is disconnected from the switch). The W5500 doesn’t send a new ARP request.\nWhat is the time live of the ARP entries in the ARP table of the W5500?. Can I force this ARP table to be erased?\n Solved by becky in post #3\nHello, The w5500 has a force ARP mode. It is a mode to transmit ARP request every packet transmission. You can enable/disable Force ARP mode using the MR register. I recommend a disable it after updating the MAC address.

In other words, you should restart your application driving W5500 socket. Try it and let us know.\n1 Reply\nbecky\nWIZnet Team\n1\nJan '18\nHello,\nThe w5500 has a force ARP mode.\nIt is a mode to transmit ARP request every packet transmission.\nYou can enable/disable Force ARP mode using the MR register.\nI recommend a disable it after updating the MAC address.\n2 Replies\nSolution\n1\nfjdepedro\nEugeny\nJan '18\nThe problem is that I’m receiving data from the remote system and I don’t know when the remote system is not receiving data.

Consider using TCP, or make PC application sending a kind of ACK UDP packet, this way your embedded device will know that PC received data (and if not, retry, then force ARP, then reopen socket).\n1 Reply\nfjdepedro\nJan '18\n Eugeny:\nThen in general your protocol is not reliable\nYes, you are right. I need to redesign the protocol.\nfjdepedro\nJan '18\n becky:\nThe w5500 has a force ARP mode.\nIt is a mode to transmit ARP request every packet transmission.\nYou can enable/disable Force ARP mode using the MR register.\nI recommend a disable it after updating the MAC address.\nThis work for me. Each 15 seconds, before sending an UDP packet, I activate bit FARP in MR register. After it, I send the UDP packet and then deactivate bit FARP. It is not necessary to close the UDP socket.\nNow, using WireShark, I can see an ARP request every 15 seconds.\n1 Reply\nbecky\nWIZnet Team\nJan '18\nGlad to hear that.\nIf you have any more problem, just let me know.\nHave a nice day, thank you\nReply\nNew & Unread Topics\nTopic\tReplies\tActivity\nW5500 TCT Pull-up resistor Wattage\nW5500\n\t1\tMay '23\nW5500 False Reset due to AC switching noise\nW5500\n\t8\tNov '23\nW5500-EVB + ESP32S3 IDF Basic Eth Example not working\nW5500\n\t3\tJul '23\nPHYCFGR register cannot be read and My code stucks at socket() function\nW5500\n\t0\tAug '23\nW5500 MQTT Issues ([Errno 13] EACCES)\nW5500\n\t1\tNov '23\nWant to read more?

Q. Why doesn't the W5500 Ethernet chip recognize a new device with the same IP but a different MAC address after swapping out the old one?
A. The W5500 chip has a 'Force ARP' mode that can be enabled or disabled using the MR register. This mode forces an ARP request with every packet sent. If the chip is not recognizing a new MAC address, enabling Force ARP can help update the ARP table. It's advisable to disable it once the MAC address is updated to avoid unnecessary traffic.
